    - **Server-Side Programming Languages:** JavaScript (Node.js), Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, etc., which handle business logic, database interactions, and server-side processing.
    - **Frameworks:** Express.js (Node.js), Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Laravel (PHP), Spring (Java), etc., which provide a structure for building web applications.
    - **Web Servers:** Software like Apache, Nginx, IIS, which serve the web pages and handle HTTP requests and responses.
3. **Databases:**
    
    - **SQL Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc., which store structured data.
    - **NoSQL Databases:** MongoDB, CouchDB, etc., which store unstructured or semi-structured data.
4. **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):**
    
    - **REST (Representational State Transfer):** A style for designing networked applications that interact over HTTP.
    - **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need.
    - **WebSockets:** A protocol for two-way communication between the client and server in real-time applications.
5. **Security:**
    
    - **Authentication and Authorization:** Ensuring that users are who they claim to be and have permission to access the resources.
    - **Data Encryption:** Using protocols like SSL/TLS to protect data in transit.
    - **Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems:** Protecting the server and data from malicious attacks.
